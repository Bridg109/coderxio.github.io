Notes:
* example of a drug shortage
* walk through steps that currently happen - manually searching - guessing on counts - waiting a day until product either comes or doesn't come
* walk through example of what it would look like with one supplier offering a real-time API
* walk through example of what it would look like to have a FHIR-based standard API framework for multiple suppliers to offer a real-time API

**CodeRx** is a collective of pharmacists and other healthcare professionals that have an interest, skill set, or passion in coding, data, or tech. Working on this project is the first of hopefully many projects where we can apply our knowledge towards something potentially cool and useful - and give others exposure to and experience with the techy side of healthcare along the way. If you're interested at all, follow along at [CodeRx.io](https://coderx.io/), check out our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/coderxio/dailymed-api), or join our [Slack channel](https://coderx.slack.com/).
