Notes:
* example of a drug shortage
* walk through steps that currently happen - manually searching - guessing on counts - waiting a day until product either comes or doesn't come
* walk through example of what it would look like with one supplier offering a real-time API
* walk through example of what it would look like to have a FHIR-based standard API framework for multiple suppliers to offer a real-time API
